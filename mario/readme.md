## Game Logic

### Starting the Game
- Clicking the **Start** button begins the game and hides the start screen.
- The `start()` function initializes game objects and starts the game loop.

### Movement

- The `update()` method applies gravity, jumping, and movement.
- The `jump()` method allows the player to jump.

### Coin Collection
- The `checkCoinCollision()` function checks if the player **collides** with a coin.
- If a collision occurs, the coin is removed, and the **score increases** by 10.

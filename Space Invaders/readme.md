- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code) to view and modify the code.

### Setup:
1. Create an `index.html` file and include the game code in a `<script>` tag or link to an external JavaScript file.
2. Ensure the required images (e.g., `player.png`, `beetlemorph.png`) are available and correctly referenced in the code.

### Run the Game:
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Use the **Arrow Keys** to move the player left and right.
3. Press the **Spacebar** to shoot projectiles.
4. Press **R** to restart the game after a game-over.

## Key Features

### 1. Player Movement
- The player can move left and right using the **arrow keys**.
- The player's position is constrained to the **canvas boundaries**.

### 2. Shooting
- The player can shoot **projectiles** by pressing the **spacebar**.
- Projectiles are reused from a **pool** to optimize performance.

### 3. Enemy Waves
- Enemies are organized into **waves** that move in a pattern.
- Each wave increases in **difficulty** by adding more enemies.

### 4. Collision Detection
- **Bounding box collision** detects when projectiles hit enemies.
- Collisions between enemies and the player reduce the **player's lives**.

### 5. Game Over
- The game ends when the player loses all **lives** or enemies reach the bottom of the screen.
- The player can restart the game by pressing **R**.
